I started my work there by first learning python, Django framewrok, Django REST API Framework for around 2 weeks along with some hands on mini projects.
AFter that i was onboarded in a team where we were working on a investment based web application that involves Large and small banks and individuals who wishes to invest money safe and hassle free.

My work was based on technologies like
	Django,
	Django REST API Fraemewrk
	Docker
	Postman
	Linux
	Pandas
	Regular Expressions
	GitLab

I specifically 
1- developed few apis for	
	- 

2- also built a small program that reads data from excel sheet and meaps that data to their database columns and inserts them, where i used pandas and list comprehensions in python3

3 - refactoring
	refactored a lot of code by removing redundant code and by centalising use of repeated string constants for which i used regular expressions to catch various strings and replaced them with unified constants
	so it was like i wrote a regular expression  which will match x strings in y files and then after verifying on clik of one button all those insttance were replaced by string constants
