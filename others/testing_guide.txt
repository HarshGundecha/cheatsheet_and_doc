- Things to test
	- model test
	- view test
	- form test ???(or this will be covered in model test ðŸ¤”??)

- Types of test cases
	- test exact on boundary value, exact inside boundary, exact above boundary, normal within boundary
		- for example when an input expects a value from 0 to 10, test for following values
			-  0, 10 	(exact boundary)
			-  1, 9 	(inside boundary)
			- -1, 11	(above boundary)
			-  5			(normal average case, inside boundary)
